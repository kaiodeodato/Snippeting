Introducing Snippeting, your one-stop shop for effortless code completion and enhanced productivity.  With Snippeting, you can create a personalized collection of snippets and variables, readily accessible at your fingertips, empowering you to code with speed and efficiency. ‚ö°Ô∏è

**Effortless Snippet Management**  

1. **Create Your Configuration File:**

   In your project's root directory, create a file named `sconfig.js`. This file will serve as your snippet repository.

2. **Define Your Snippets:**   

   Use the following format to define your snippets in `sconfig.js`:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = [
     { "key1": "snippet1" },
     { "key2": "snippet2" },
     // ... more snippets
   ];

Key: Choose a short and descriptive name for your snippet (e.g., myReactForm).
Snippet: Enter the actual code you want to insert (e.g., complete React form component).

Showcase the versatility of Snippeting with more complex snippets:

 ```javascript
module.exports = [
  {
    "myReactForm": `import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Form = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (e) => setValue(e.target.value);

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Handle form submission
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default Form;`
  },

  // ... other snippets
];
```

As you start typing a snippet key in your code, Snippeting will intelligently suggest the entire snippet for quick insertion. This saves you time and effort, allowing you to focus on the core logic of your code.
